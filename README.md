# pymovies
A simple Flask app to pull movies that I rated on IMDB and present them in better view with the ratings, IMDB scraping was done using BeautifulSoup.
The app can be deployed in many ways such as **local-pyton**, **local-docker**, kubernetes, **GCP (Cloud Run)**, **Azure (App service)**.
Please see deployment guide for more details.
